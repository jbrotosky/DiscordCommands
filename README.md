# Discord Spam/Exploit Bot

This is a bot I wrote for Discord that uses known methods to generate havok in a Discord Channel. This is meant to be used on a windows machine. I have provided an executable version for those without Python installed.


## Features

- Pre-built Message Array for Spamming
- Pre-built GIF Array for Spamming MLG GIFS
- @Mention Spamming
- Glitched Mention
- Send a Message Over the 2,000 Character Limit
- Change Selected Discord Channel
- Store/Change Discord Token


## Installation

For those using the Python script, this shouldn't require any non-default Python libraries. And for those using the executable, you should just be able to double click it to run.
    
## Usage/Examples

On your first run, it will ask you for your Discord token. If you don't know how to find that, a simple Google search will show you.
After that it will ask you what channel ID you would like to start posting to. This also is simple with a quick Google search. After the first run, it will no longer ask for your Discord token, as it is stored in a temp file. If you need to change this later, it is option 7.
